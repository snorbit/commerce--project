        <h2>Have a Problem? Here's How to Solve It.</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, things don't go as planned. You might have a problem with your new phone, your bill, or your service. If that happens, it's important to know your rights and how to make a complaint.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Contact Your Provider First</h3>
        <p>The first and most important step is to contact your mobile provider directly. Give them a chance to fix the problem. You can usually find a dedicated complaints section on their website with a phone number or email address. Explain the issue clearly and tell them what you'd like them to do to resolve it.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Escalate to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO)</h3>
        <p>If you're not happy with your provider's response, or if they haven't fixed the problem, you can contact the TIO. The TIO is a <strong>free and independent</strong> dispute resolution service for phone and internet complaints.</p>
        
        <h4>How the TIO Process Works:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>You make a complaint:</strong> You can do this online or over the phone. Tell them about your problem and what a fair solution would look like.</li>
            <li><strong>Referral to your provider:</strong> The TIO will refer your complaint to a dedicated team at your provider and give them 10 business days to work with you to solve it.</li>
            <li><strong>Investigation:</strong> If the problem is still not resolved, the TIO can investigate further. They act like an umpire, not taking sides, to find a fair and reasonable outcome.</li>
            <li><strong>Binding Decision:</strong> If necessary, the TIO can make a decision that is binding on your provider.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>You can contact the TIO through their website or by phone:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.tio.com.au/" target="_blank">www.tio.com.au</a></li>
            <li><strong>Phone:</strong> 1800 062 058</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What About the ACCC?</h3>
        <p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) doesn't resolve individual complaints. However, if you believe a provider is systematically doing the wrong thing (like widespread misleading advertising), you can report it to the ACCC. This helps them enforce the rules and protect all consumers.</p>
