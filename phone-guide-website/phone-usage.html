        <h2>More Than Just a Phone</h2>
        <p>For young people today, a smartphone is so much more than just a device for making calls. It's a gateway to a rich and complex world of creativity, community, and entertainment. Research shows that by age 11, over half of young people in the US have their own smartphone, and that number jumps to 84% for teenagers.</p>

        <h3>A World of Creativity and Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Smartphones are a powerful tool for creative expression. Young people use apps like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pinterest:</strong> For finding drawing inspiration and fashion ideas.</li>
            <li><strong>Tumblr:</strong> For writing, reading, and sharing creative work.</li>
            <li><strong>Webtoon:</strong> To read comics and learn from creators.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Connecting with Communities</h3>
        <p>Smartphones are also central to how young people connect with others who share their interests. This can be through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Snapchat and Instagram:</strong> For sharing selfies, keeping up with friends, and following favorite artists and celebrities.</li>
            <li><strong>Fan Group Chats:</strong> Large group chats on platforms like Snapchat allow fans of music groups (like K-pop bands), TV shows, or hobbies to connect with people from all over the world.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Entertainment on the Go</h3>
        <p>From watching videos to listening to music, smartphones are a primary source of entertainment. Many young people discover new music and artists through collaborative online projects like multi-animator music videos, and then use their phones to dive deeper into the fandom.</p>
