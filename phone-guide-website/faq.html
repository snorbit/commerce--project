        <h2>Your Questions Answered</h2>

        <h3>What's the difference between a pre-paid and a post-paid plan?</h3>
        <p>A pre-paid plan is one where you pay for your service upfront. A post-paid plan (also known as a contract) is one where you pay for your service at the end of each month. You can learn more on our <a href="contracts-vs-prepaid.html">Contracts vs. Pre-Paid</a> page.</p>

        <h3>Can I keep my phone number if I switch providers?</h3>
        <p>Yes! In Australia, you have the right to keep your phone number when you switch providers. This is called 'porting'. When you sign up with a new provider, they will ask you if you want to port your existing number.</p>

        <h3>What does 'data banking' mean?</h3>
        <p>Data banking, or data rollover, allows you to save your unused data from one month and use it in the next. This is a great feature if your data usage varies from month to month.</p>

        <h3>What happens if I go over my data limit?</h3>
        <p>On most modern plans, you won't be charged extra if you go over your data limit. Instead, your data speed will be 'throttled' (slowed down) to a much lower speed until your next billing cycle. This is usually fast enough for sending messages and emails, but not for streaming video.</p>

        <h3>Do I need to get my phone repaired by the manufacturer?</h3>
        <p>No, you don't. There are many independent repair shops that can fix common problems like cracked screens, often for a much lower price than the manufacturer. However, be aware that using an unauthorised repairer may void your warranty.</p>
